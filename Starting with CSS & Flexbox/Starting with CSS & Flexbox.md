# Starting with CSS & Flexbox

#### Diff. between HTML & CSS -
- HTML -> Gives structure to web pages.
  - E.g. It gives Skelton - provide structre of human body head, body, lower body
- CSS -> Gives beautification or skin provide to our HTML.
  - E.g. It gives color, beauty & unique tone means the skin part above HTML is done by CSS.
- JS -> Gives functionality to HTML.
  - E.g. It gives brain functionality to our body, behaviour i.e. JS
<br>

#### Default CSS -
- Default styling are depends on our browser which are set by default.
  - E.g. Chrome default styling to text color is black.
  - E.g. Chrome & safari browser show different "Click Me" button color or styling but color is same. i.e. that reason behind Chrome & Safari have different CSS or default Styling are different.
- Browser have default styling. i.e. Chrome is different user agent & Safari is different user agent.
- `Inspect mode` -> click on button element -> default button{_ _ _} called as `user agent stylesheet`.
- `Agent` : any one can request them or reder it i.e. agent.
- We `can't change user agent stylesheet`. but we can do override that `user agent stylesheet`.
- CSS -> means `only override of style` on top of it.

## CSS - `Cascading Stylesheets`
- Cascading : `kinds of overlaping or overriding`.
  - Cascade one thing on to other another thing.
  - E.g. Shape of yellow color box cascade blue color box, this does not mean that the yellow has been removed i.e. yellow overlape by blue -> `Cascading`.
- Using CSS we can cascading to stylesheets.
- E.g. Adding Style attribute in button
- ``` CSS
  <button style="background-color: red;" >Click Me</button>
  ```
- we can't remove browser CSS or not change browser CSS, we can only `cascade`.
- In `Inspect mode` -> "element.style{_ _ _}" has taken background color as "red".
- It only cascade only browser default property background-color as "buttonface" cascade with background color as "red".
- They can't cascade whole properties all other property are same show as user agent can give i.e user agent chrome.



> NOTE :
> - `CSS` -> means `Properties: Values` E.g. bacground-color: red; i.e. property.
> - CSS doesn't limit on any creativity.
