## Objects 

#### What is objects? (in every language)
- Objects means, that `represent real world entities`.
- Every thing is entity that have some property.
  - E.g. Pencil is entity becz, those have color, price... that have own properties & functionality.
- `Object` - Objects is an entity, which has properties & some functionality.
- #### Functionality in Object Oriented Way -> `Methods`.
- Properties means `Attributes`.
  - Attributes are color, weight,..
- Methods means `Actions or Functions`.

#### Difference in Methods & Functions 
- Actually there is no difference between them.
- But, function is standalone -> that called function.
- Function is a part of object -> that called Method (Method say, context of Object).
