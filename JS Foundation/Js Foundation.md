# Js Foundation


## Marathon Track -
1. Basic Revision with Code - `22/2`
2. Draw Digrams - `23/2`
3. Project - `24/2`
4. Machine Coding Interview-1 - `25/2`
5. Machine Coding Interview-2 - `26/2`

<br>

## Code Centric foundation - 

### JS
- JS or other any language always start from
  - [x] What is the `data` we have?
  - [x] What can we do `operations`?

<br>

### What is the data? & what to do? or what not to do?

#### Data -

- We have data as -
- ```JS
  // data
  hitesh
  19
  ```
- We can store this data in `memory`.
- For storing data in the memory we need `reference`.
  - **hitesh** reference is --> name.
  - **19** reference is --> age.
- That of work in JS or any other language.
<br>

- In JS we have 3 different ways of data storing i.e. variable declaration -

1. var  
- ```JS
  // Avoid that **var** in JS mostly becz, Scope issue
  var name = "hitesh"
  ```
- From many of last years this very standard practice then they are not used.
<br>

> [!NOTE]
> - We have only 2 options for variable declaration (storing data in memory).
>   - **let**
>   - **const**

<br>

2. **let**
-  `let` -> very predictable scope. i.e. we know what is exactly work?
-  ```JS
   let name = "hitesh"
   ```

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> - In starting phase of programing world we say, **always make variables using let** becz, we think that we change value in future.
> - **But**, we have get experience in JS it will seem that prefer `const` that are easy in programing.

<br>

3. **const**
- `const` -> make easy work in programing (we can use mostly `const`)
-  ```JS
   // const also called as variable & cost
   const pi = 3.14
   ```

<br>

#### Datatypes -

> [!TIP]
> `Extra Q&A`
> - Scaling is not rocket science. i.e. already scale up before its a live.
> - Why FB millions users not 502 gateway Error occurs. becz, difference between average traffic & spike trafic.
> - Somtimes that is also DDOS(**Distributed Denied Of Service**) Attack which is very common in AWS.
> - In DDOS many traffic as a BOT Traffic its very common scenario & don't get even that much spin up load balancer to make more bills i.e. scale in limited amount becz, go & controllable manner.
> - Spike traffic is mostly 5-10 min only not more. It just like earthquike.
> - It possible to prevent DDOS Attack? :- That is like the duty of cloud, if they can block Ip's.
> - In DDOS attack, also send request from our machine also its also part of Bot army.
<br>
> - Razorpay interview questions & how that build on top?
> - Common qurstion on machine coding round -
>   - Enable nagative indexing in JS. - e.g.
>   - ```JS
>     // That type of questions in Machine coding round
>     const fruits = [1,2,3,4,5]
>     fruits[1]
>     fruits[-1]  // how to enable this? fruits[-1] i.e. last value
>     ```
>  - Currying concept in JS.(whats on code & what task we next)
>  - Reduce documentation learn with different perspective.
