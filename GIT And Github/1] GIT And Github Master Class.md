# GIT And Github Master Class -

### What we can learn?
- Q. What's GIT and Github?
- Q. How does version controling work?
- Q. How to handle big size of code or codebases? & how to push it on git?
- Q. How to big teams are colabration?
<br>

> NOTE* - All above Question are very sensual thing are required from you start beginning.
<br>

### Steps before learning anything we can understand problem statments -

E.g. Perspective through Coder -
#### As coder Problem 
- After at mid level project adding new code & adding new features. Project structure or line of code complexity increases.
- Increase folders, files, 500-600 loc & grow it.
- As the `complexity of the project` or `loc increases` its difficult to manage it.

#### What problem we can forcast or detecting?
- Our code is too big & segregate or separated it on multiple files.
- & What problem problem we can finds?
  - Tracking,
  - Code backup.
-  Below `Google Doc` history example is a same for code write by coder.

E.g. - Google Docs maintain linear history. What's benefit of maintain history?
       - Tracking (Whats changes past time)
       - Direct go that time & come current time.
       - It's very important thing for we can work on big size document.
<br>

##### 1st Problem : Understanding the problem Tracking
- History can easy to tracking of whats time to we can change code, for reword code, What past lines make bugs?
- Solution :

##### 2nd Problem : Backup
- Collaboration is one of them problem (Multiple peoples can't work on single PC).

 <br>

##### Solution : History Management
- Problem is - we can write code on "local machine" how to make history of it?
- For solving this type of problem we required one `System.`
- System that maintain history of local code.
- We can solve this type of problem through `VCS.`
- VCS(`Version Control System`) that system can  basically do versioning of your code or files.
- Versioning is nothing but a "maintaining history".
- VCS E.g. GIT, Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce... etc.


> NOTE* - <br>
> - GIT build by <b>Linus Torvalds,</b> is also build <b>Linux</b>.
> - Features - Its supoort Branching but Mercurial not supported branching.
>            - Linux have active contributors.
> - This reasons <b>GIT</b> in market.
> - Then <b>GIT</b> most popular one in the market.

Q. What is Network Simulation?
Q. How to makes your own VCS like GIT system?
```

### GIT internal working -

- Q. How to use GIT?
  - On Terminal : step to open VS Code using GIT
  - mkdir(make folder) - hello-git
    - ```mkdir hello-git```
    - ```cd hello-git```
    - ```code .```
  - Our project name is <b>hello-git</b>
