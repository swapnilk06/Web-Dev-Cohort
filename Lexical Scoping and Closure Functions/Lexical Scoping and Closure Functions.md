# 18 : Lexical Scoping and Closure Functions (JS - Foundation & Project & Machine Coding course)

### What we learn?
- [x] What lexical scoping?
- [x] What closures?
- [x] Practically uses of lexical scoping & closures.
- [x] Practical application with DOM examples with uses of closures.
- [x] Which pattern closures used actually. 

### What we learn next time?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In interview ask indirectly question on Lexical Scoping and Closure.
> - Without lexical scoping is part of closure, without lexical scoping closure are not possible.
> - We can best playing with Lexical Scoping & Closures then -> `More increases our code quality`.

## Lexical Scoping & Closures
- Lexical Scoping & Closures mostly used `indirectly` rather than directly.

<br>

## Lexical Scoping 
- Its very simple concepts but, very important.
- Examples :
```JS
let fname = 'Piyush';

console.log('Value of Fname is', fname);

// Task -
// - Why that code run? & Why access fname variable? becz, its in a scope.
// all 2 statements (let fname & console.log) are in same scope.
