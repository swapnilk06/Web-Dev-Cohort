#### `Bonus Class` : `11-1-25`


#### We understanding base(foundation) `without code` then we write good code significantly.
- Computer means `Transfering information form 1 side to other side`.

### Jargon in computer -
Example through website `https://hiteshchoudhary.com/` & What's reason that website is so simple? - becz of, learning base from that understood easily.
<br>

#### Q. What can we learn in details?
  - How to computer find?
  - Behind the sence how to work?
  - How to my computer find that website from in world-wide other websites?
<br>

#### Perspective of learning -
- How to does website make fancy? How these technology?  What's that technology? these are `timewasting things`...
- We learn only that how its working `behind the scenes`. That are understand in level of 0's & 1's.
- That things we easily understand, then any other tech like GraphQL, API, Server, MongoDB, mySQL these are easily understood.

# HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

#### All things of computer are not came from computer, that are came from `real world`, thats things are so common in real world.

  - Protocol : `Set of rules`.
  - Transfer : `Moving from 1 side to other side`.
  - Hyertext : `It means only text documents that points another documents`.
    - Beginning of internet that time scientist work as only share <b>Text files</b> among ourselves. e.g. that reels send between me & my friend.
    - Hypertext means that have only <b>text documents</b> but, that <b>text document that shares links that points another documents</b>.
    - One such document that includes hyperlinks or hypertext that will be taking out form that document. That is work only of <b>hypertext</b>.
    - Beginning time only share text(image sharing not present that time) with reference document that show learn link to learn other document.
    - E.g. like wikipedia(without images).
<br>

- Protocol making time they insure it can be `Human Readable`.
- All data sends from HTTP are all `Readable`.
- All data we can seen becz, in protocol as mention that `data` for `Readable`.

### Access `Human Readable` data through -
  - Network tab visibility
  - Inspect element
  - Page source

### `HTTP` as `Stateless Protocol`
- State : `Maintain state`
  - Example as game checkpoint, amazon/netflix movie watching pause & we continue from that pause time. i.e. is  `Maintain state`.

- Stateless : `Not maintain state`
  - Everytime we visit a page, we are a new user.
  - Example we can open youtube in incognito mode, as country wise all youtube videos are visible as same (becz, no any reference/preference, not active any account) without changing alogorithm by youtube. i.e. `Stateless Protocol`.
  - In `Stateless Protocol` no any memory of `previous request`.
  - We visit 10 time that also shows same page content.

#### `HTTP` as `Stateless Protocol` then how to build my account? How to bookmark in youtube? How does are possible?

> NOTE* : <br>
> In `HTTP` no any rule at present for maintain state. And not any provisions came that rules came in further.
> HTTP is simply as sent request from computer to server & computer get respose from server. That our`HTTP`.
