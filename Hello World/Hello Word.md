# HTML - Hello World

> NOTE :
> - We understanding base(foundation) `without code` then we write good code significantly.
> - Computer means `Transfering information form 1 side to other side`.

### Jargon in computer -
Example through website `https://hiteshchoudhary.com/` & What's reason that website is so simple? - becz of, learning base from that understood easily.
<br>

#### Q. What can we learn in details?
  - How to computer find?
  - Behind the sence how to work?
  - How to my computer find that website from in world-wide other websites?
<br>

#### Perspective of learning -
- How to does website make fancy? How these technology?  What's that technology? these are `timewasting things`...
- We learn only that how its working `behind the scenes`. That are understand in level of 0's & 1's.
- That things we easily understand, then any other tech like GraphQL, API, Server, MongoDB, mySQL these are easily understood.

# HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

> NOTE :
> - All things of computer are not came from computer, that are came from `real world`, thats things are so common in real world.

- Protocol : `Set of rules`.
- Transfer : `Moving from 1 side to other side`.
- Hyertext : `It means only text documents that points another documents`.
    
- Beginning of internet that time scientist work as only share <b>Text files</b> among ourselves. E.g. that reels send between me & my friend.
    - Hypertext means -> that have only <b>text documents</b> but, that <b>text document that shares links that points another documents</b>.
    - One such document that includes hyperlinks or hypertext that will be taking out form that document. i.e. work only of <b>hypertext</b>.
    - Beginning time only share text(image sharing not present that time) with reference document that show learn link to learn other document.
    - E.g. like wikipedia(without images).
<br>

- Protocol making time they insure it can be `Human Readable`.
- All data sends from HTTP all are `Readable`.
- All data we can seen becz, in protocol as mention that `data` for `Readable`.

#### Human Readable data access through :
  - 1] Network tab visibility
  - 2] Inspect element
  - 3] Page source
<br>

### Stateless Protocol

- HTTP as `Stateless Protocol`

- State : means `Maintain state`
  - E.g. as game checkpoint, amazon/netflix movie watching pause & we continue from that pause time. i.e. is  `Maintain state`.

- Stateless : `Not maintain state`
  - Everytime we visit a page, they consider we are a new user.
    - E.g. we can open youtube in "incognito mode"(as country wise set youtube videos visible as same) becz, we have no any reference/preference, no any account logined, if youtube doesn't change its alogorithm. i.e. `Stateless Protocol`.
  - In `Stateless Protocol -> no any memory of "previous request"`.
    - E.g. We visit 10 times, everytime we can view same page.

#### Q. If we say, HTTP as a Stateless Protocol then, How does possible to create our account? How to possible bookmark in youtube? How does are possible?
- In `HTTP` -> `There is no such rule for maintain state`. Neither is its in today's date nor should it be.
- HTTP -> `Protocol/Rules`
  - E.g. HTTP simply work that, from one side computer "sent request" to server & computer get "respose from server". That our `HTTP`.
- We can send web request & we get back web response. i.e. work of HTTP. But. that is not sufficient.
<br>

- Computer scientist think that, the web is advancing & introduce images in web that's celebrating movement & big acheivement in the web.

#### Q. How to store a state?
- We
