# HTML - Hello World

> NOTE :
> - We understanding base(foundation) `without code` then we write good code significantly.
> - Computer means `Transfering information form 1 side to other side`.
<br>

### Jargon in computer -
Example through website `https://hiteshchoudhary.com/` & What's reason that website is so simple? - becz of, learning base from that understood easily.
<br>

#### Q. What can we learn in details?
  - How to computer find?
  - Behind the sence how to work?
  - How to my computer find that website from in world-wide other websites?
<br>

#### Perspective of learning -
- How to does website make fancy? How these technology?  What's that technology? these are `timewasting things`...
- We learn only that how its working `behind the scenes`. That are understand in level of 0's & 1's.
- That things we easily understand, then any other tech like GraphQL, API, Server, MongoDB, mySQL these are easily understood.
<br>

## HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

> NOTE :
> - All things of computer are not came from computer, that are came from `real world`, thats things are so common in real world.

- Protocol : `Set of rules`.
- Transfer : `Moving from 1 side to other side`.
- Hyertext : `It means only text documents that points another documents`.
    
- Beginning of internet that time scientist work as only share <b>Text files</b> among ourselves.
  - E.g. that reels send between me & my friend.
- Hypertext means -> that have only <b>text documents</b> but, that <b>text document that shares links that points another documents</b>.
- One such document that includes hyperlinks or hypertext that will be taking out form that document. i.e. work only of <b>hypertext</b>.
- Beginning time only share text(image sharing not present that time) with reference document that show learn link to learn other document.
  - E.g. like wikipedia(without images).
<br>

- Protocol making time they insure it can be `Human Readable`.
- All data sends from HTTP all are `Readable`.
- All data we can seen becz, in protocol as mention that `data` for `Readable`.

#### Human Readable data access through :
  - 1] Network tab visibility
  - 2] Inspect element
  - 3] Page source
<br>

### Stateless Protocol

- HTTP as `Stateless Protocol`

#### State : means `Maintain state`
  - E.g. as game checkpoint, amazon/netflix movie watching pause & we continue from that pause time. i.e. is  `Maintain state`.

#### Stateless : `Not maintain state`
  - Everytime we visit a page, they consider we are a new user.
    - E.g. we can open youtube in "incognito mode"(as country wise set youtube videos visible as same) becz, we have no any reference/preference, no any account logined, if youtube doesn't change its alogorithm. i.e. `Stateless Protocol`.
  - In `Stateless Protocol -> no any memory of "previous request"`.
    - E.g. We visit 10 times, everytime we can view same page.

#### Q. If we say, HTTP as a Stateless Protocol then, How does possible to create our account? How to possible bookmark in youtube? How does are possible?
- In `HTTP` -> `There is no such rule for maintain state`. Neither is its in today's date nor should it be.
- HTTP -> `Protocol/Rules`
  - E.g. HTTP simply work that, from one side computer "sent request" to server & computer get "respose from server". That our `HTTP`.
- We can send web request & we get back web response. i.e. work of HTTP. But. that is not sufficient.
<br>

> NOTE : Computer scientist think that, the web is advancing & introduce images in web that's celebrating movement & big acheivement in the web.
<br>


### Session

#### Q. How to store a state?
- After HTTP we need of session.
  - E.g. Doctor appointment with you(that give time only for you), Session teacher with you i.e. Real world example we can store our information at session.
- `Session` can `stored our state`.
-  Session work simple have to `remember intraction between browser & server` in the format of `Cookie`.
-  E.g. name = hitesh <- that is also cookie.
- `Cookie` -> Key value pairs. It is just a information.
- `Information`or`Cookie` also can be send by browser to server or also send by server to browser.
  - E.g. No cookie came from sever side or not send cookie by browser i.e. Not get any information. 

#### Q. What types of information on cookie?
<br>

### HTTP Headers 
- `Headers` : Whenever browser can send info that called Headers. i.e. `headers means information`.
- What type of information can send by HTTP Headers :
  - `Client` : Who is the client?
  - `Browser` : Who is the browser?
  - `Date & Time` : What is date & time?
  - `Cookie to store` : Do you want to keep stor cookie or not?
  - E.g. That are questions, client have ask questioning stored in client, Browser info that login from safari or chrome...

#### What will I do after knowing these information?
- E.g. We knowing you login from safari, then we give popups as "Please download our IOS app." Or We login form android, them we give popup as "Please download our Android app." i.e. `good usecases`.
- E.g. We also show ads.
  - Traveling time we search best hotel in ways, ads suggest best hotels are in budget.
-  All informations of `HTTP Headers` are store on server & it came from client.
<br>

### Request - Response Model
- That simply as, broswer send resquest to web server & server return reponse to browser. i.e. `Request - Response Model`.
- Browser send `HTTP Headers` information & same `HTTP Headers` information can server send to browser.
  - E.g. Browser carries some information like Who am I?, What is my OS?, Which one is my browser?, When I request send?... also that tye of info server can send to browser like You were talking about this website, Take this website.

#### Q. Response is a cookie?
- In response may or may not be contain a cookie.
- May be in response cookie are send or may be not send a cookie in response.
- High chance to send cookie in response.

#### Typpe of Request
- Which types of request browser can send to server. lik Get, Post, Delete...
