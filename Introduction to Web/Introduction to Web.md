# Introduction to Web

- All IT sector run on data transfer means internets concepts, N/W concepts, backends concepts, database concepts i.e. all work on `how to data move?`
- All of data transfer backside one model is work i.e. `OSI Model` (Open System Interconnect).
<br>

#### OSI Model -
- OSI model there are 7 layers.
- That seven layers can transfer our data from one side to another side.
- 7] `Physical Layer` - our real physical(it work on bit 0's & 1's).
  - E.g. Wire is our physical layer.
- 6] `Data Link Layer` - that's work on the frames.
  - E.g. IP frame, TCP frame, Header frame.
  - Transfering data frames then `Data Link Layer transfer it data frames to Physical Layer`.
  - i.e. Data Link Layers frames that travel to Physical Layer using 0's & 1's.
- 5] `Network Layer` - it basically work as `Routing`(Network Layer work as IP addressing).
  - E.g. Where to take the data from? Where do you want to take it? i.e. all routing part thar are part of Network Layer.
  - `Network Layer work` is whatever our data & add that frames & transfer to Data Link Layer & Data Link Layer tranfer to Physical Layer.
- 4] `Transport Layer` - our TCP & UDP protocol that work on Transport Layer.
